# Metropolitan-City-Design
A C-based interactive console application to explore the city of Mysore! 

# Features
Read and display Mysore city information from places.txt

Add and delete city-to-city road distances in distances.txt

Represent city roads using adjacency lists and matrices

Apply Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms to generate Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)

Perform DFS and BFS graph traversals

Search city names using brute-force and trie-based pattern matching

Sort cities based on population using various sorting algorithms

Use a Segment Tree to perform range minimum queries on distances

# Data Structures and Their Purpose
## Sorting Algorithms
| Algorithm      | Purpose                                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bubble Sort    | Sorts cities in ascending order based on population        |
| Selection Sort | Sorts cities in descending order based on population       |
| Insertion Sort | Another method for sorting population in descending order  |
| Quick Sort     | Sorts edges by weight in ascending order for Kruskal's MST |
